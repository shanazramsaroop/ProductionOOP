**Production Project** </br>
 </br>

Create a working version of a production software in which a user can add new products to a database and view the products </br>
</br>

This program is for a media player production facility, which will help them to keep track of what products are produced. When a new product is added, instead of physically documenting it, the workers can add it to this program and the new product will be added to a Products table. At any time, a list of existing products are displayed in the product line tab. Additionally, when products that are on the system are produced, the workers can enter it into the system to be recorded and added to a Production Records table. Workers can even select the quantity that is being produced so they do not have to repeatedly add a product to the table. The software also allows management to be able to know which employee logged which products, so everytime an employee adds a product, they have to enter their name and password.
